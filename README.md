 `react-scripts-ts-enhanced`
I find [react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts) very handy, but it lacks some features I need. Thus, react-scripts-ts-enhanced has been born.

## How to install
  npm install -g create-react-app

```sh
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts-enhanced
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Features
None at the moment

## Planned
* SASS files support
* CSS and SASS modules support
